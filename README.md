# Neo-Velocity-Redefining-Speed
Welcome to "Neo Velocity: Redefining Speed", a fast-paced cyberpunk speedrun/movement game! 
In this game, you'll race against your ghost to beat your best time and climb up the online leaderboard.

Gameplay:
The gameplay is inspired by "Titanfall 2 Gauntlet", where players must navigate a complex obstacle course as quickly as possible. 
You'll need to use all of your movement abilities to traverse the environment quickly and efficiently. 
You can race against your ghost, which represents your best time on the course, and compare your progress to others on the online leaderboard. 
In addition, you can use left click and right click to fire a rocket launcher and C4 respectively, which you can use to take down obstacles and speed up your progress through the course.

Input Recording:
The game also includes a feature that saves your inputs locally in a file, so you can review them and display them. 
This means that you can analyze your movements and refine your technique for each run.

How to Play:
To play the game, simply download and run the executable file on your system. 
Use the WASD or arrow keys to move, and use the spacebar to jump. 
Use left click to fire the rocket launcher and right click to place C4 to take down obstacles. 
You'll need to use a combination of these inputs to navigate the obstacles as quickly as possible. 
To view your saved inputs, go to the game directory and look for the "input.txt" file.

We hope you enjoy playing "Neo Velocity: Redefining Speed" and that you find the gameplay challenging and engaging.
